2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Navigate to the API section
4. Create a new API key
5. Add the key to your `.env` file

## Extension Ideas

- Add user authentication
- Implement email forwarding for automatic checking
- Create a database to store analysis history
- Build a browser extension for quick analysis
- Add reporting and sharing features
